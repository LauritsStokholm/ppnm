Monte Carlo method: 

Estimate the number PI using the Monte Carlo method
(https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monte_Carlo_method#Overview)

Using the

A) Build a multiprocessing program with pthreads that implements the above
algorithm. HINT: Do not use rand as RNG, it is not necessarily thread-safe:
Read: man rand_r and use rand_r instead.


B) (Optional) Do the same using OpemMP.
C) (Optional) Investigate the convergence of the result as function of N (probably 1/âˆšN).
D) (Optional) Do the above exercises using one of the quasi-random (low-descrepancy) generators from GSL.
