This exercise is about the GSL integration routine QAGS

1) Calculate the integral of ln(x)/sqrt(x) over [0, 1]
2) (optional) Using one of the GSL integration routines, implement the 
error-function using its integral representation. Make a plot.

3) Using one of the GSL integration routines, implement the Bessel function (of
the first kind) using its integral representation.
