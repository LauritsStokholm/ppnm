Objective: Implement the Newton's method with numerical Jacobian and
back-tracking linesearch, and use it the Rosenbrock function. Then solve for
Bound states of hydrogen atom with shooting bethod for boundary value problems
and investigate better boundary conditions for the hydrogen atom problem.
/-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Overview: I have solved this with my own implementation (in this folder) and
using the GSL algorithms (see 08_Roots_GSL)

1) GS_decomp.c contains the Gram-Schmidt method for linear equations (see Homework 02)
2) main.h      contains a glossary of functions and structures
3) library.c   contains a personal implementation of a basic linear algebra library
4) main.c      contains functions calls of each task.
5) newton.c    contains the Newton's method with numerical Jacobians by finite
               differences.
6) ode.c       contains the rkstep implementations for both 12 and 23 
               (see Homework 05).
7) task_a.c    contains the solution to task A, with Rosenbrock function
8) task_bc.c   contains the solution to task B and C for Hydrogen atom

All tasks are done. 10/10
