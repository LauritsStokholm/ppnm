Objective: Implement the Jacobi algorithm for matrix diagonalisation
(also called matrix eigenvalue decomposition or eigendecomposition)
/-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Overview:
1) main.h      contains a glossary of functions and structures
2) library.c   contains a personal implementation of a basic linear algebra library
3) main.c      contains functions calls of each task
4) task_X.c    contains the X'th task for both A and B.
5) utilities.c contains the two-sided Jacobi method and the sweep method.
6) gsl_timer.c contains the implementation in GSL for comparison.
7) my_timer.c  contains the relevant code for comparison of GSL.

All tasks are done. 10/10
