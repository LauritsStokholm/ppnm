Objective: Fit a linear combination of given functions to a (measured) data
set, with uncertainties of measurements (error-bars).

/-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Overview:
1) main.h      contains a glossary of functions and structures
2) library.c   contains a personal implementation of a basic linear algebra library
3) main.c      contains both tasks A and B (see below)
4) data.c      contains an alternative handling of the data, appropriate for
               larger data sets. (This was succeded by a quick and dirty method)
5) utilities.c contains the GS orthogonalisation methods

All tasks are done. 10/10
