Objective: Implement subroutine that integrates a function f(x) over [a, b]
with the absolute accuracy goal delta and relative accuracy goal epsilon.
The subroutine should return the estimate of the integral, Q, with the error
smaller than delta+epsilon*abs(Q)

/-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Overview:
I have implemented a recursive adaptive integrator (task A) and a
Clenshaw-Curtis variable transformation for open quadratures (task B), and
generalised these integrators to accept infinite limits (task C). This was
compared to the GSL integration routines.

1) main.h      contains a glossary of functions for task A and task B
2) library.c   contains a personal implementation of a basic linear algebra library
3) main.c      contains functions calls of each task.
4) task_a.c    contains the X'th task for both A and B (B: store data for plot)
5) threebody.c contains the task C
6) ode.c       contains the rkstep implementations for both 12 and 23.

All tasks are done. 10/10
(I prefer the formatting for viewing the results in command-line over the result.txt)
