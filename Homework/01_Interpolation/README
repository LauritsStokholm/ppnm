Objective: Implement functions for interpolation of tabulated data.

Problem:

A) (6 points) Linear spline (linear interpolation)
a1) Implement a function that interpolates the given tabulated function, {x[i], y[i]}, at a given point z using linear spline interpolation.

The function must first find (by binary search) the interval where z is located, x[i]≤z≤x[i+1], and then calculate the interpolated value using linear spline,

a2) Implement a function that calculates the intergral of the linear spline of the tabulated data from the point x[0] to the given point z. The integral must be calculated analytically,

a3) Make some indicative plots to prove that your linear spline and your
integrator work as intended. Compare with GSL's [gsl_interp_linear] and
[gsl_interp_eval_integ].

Location of the index i of the interval containing z, x[i]<z<x[i+1], must(!) be
done using binary search.

B) (3 points) Quadratic spline

b1) Implement quadratic spline with derivative and integral. Make some illustrative plots.

Note that quadratic splines should only be used for learning, for practical applications always use cubic splines instead.

C) (1 points) Cubic spline
c1) Implement cubic spline with derivative and integral.
c2) Compare with the cubic spline routines from GSL.
