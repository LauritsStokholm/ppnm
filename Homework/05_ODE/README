Objective: Implement an embedded Runge-Kutta stepper (for ODE integration).
Use this on some interesting specific cases, such as
A) u'' = -u
B) SIR-model of epidemic development
C) Newtonian gravitational three-body problem.
/-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Overview:

I have implemented both rkstep12 and rkstep23, which can be seen in all plots.
1) main.h      contains a glossary of functions and structures
2) library.c   contains a personal implementation of a basic linear algebra library
3) main.c      contains functions calls of each task.
4) task_a.c    contains the X'th task for both A and B (B: store data for plot)
5) threebody.c contains the task C
6) ode.c       contains the rkstep implementations for both 12 and 23.

All tasks are done. 10/10
