Objective: Implement the quasi-newton minimisation method with numerical
gradient, back-tracking linesearch and rank-1 update.

Then find a minimum of the Rosenbrock's valley function, the Himmelblau's
function and record the number of steps for the algorithm to converge.

Given data from an experiment involving the Higgs boson, the Breit-Wigner
function is fitted and the mass and width of the Higgs boson is determined as
parameters by minimisation.

Lastly a downhill simplex method is implemented.

Overview:

1) higgs.dat   contains the given data for fitting Breit-Wigner function
2) main.h      contains a glossary of functions and structures
3) library.c   contains a personal implementation of a basic linear algebra library
4) main.c      contains functions calls of each task.
5) qnewton.c   contains the quasi newton minimisation method with Hessian
               matrices, where updates are dependent on the numerical Jacobians
               by finite differences.
6) mysimplex.c contains my nelder-mead downhill - simplex method, for task C
               using my own linear algebra structures (see Homework 02)
7) task_a.c    contains the solution to task A, with Rosenbrock/Himmelblau
               functions
8) task_b.c    contains the solution to task B for fitting Breit-Wigner
               function

All tasks are done. 10/10
